Overview of USAID-Tool-1
===========================

Purpose
=======

**USAID-Tool-1** is designed to monitor and illustrate the acceleration needed to achieve universal access to clean water and sanitation, based on USAID’s system strengthening efforts. Using data from the **International Futures (IF) model**, the tool combines Python-based data transformations with PowerBI visualizations to support data-driven insights and planning.

Objectives
==========

1. **Monitor WASH Progress**: Track the amount and rate of WASH (Water, Sanitation, and Hygiene) progress as a result of USAID’s system strengthening efforts.
2. **Evaluate Broader Impact**: Understand and improve the impact of WASH programming beyond USAID’s direct interventions throughout the Global Water Strategy period.
3. **Pilot for Replication**: Provide recommendations on the best ‘lean’ monitoring approach that can be effectively replicated in 22 countries.

Components
==========

USAID-Tool-1 consists of three main components:

1. **Data Input**: Raw data derived from the IF model, household surveys, and secondary sources, containing historical and projected indicators related to water and sanitation.
2. **Data Transformation**: A Jupyter Notebook processes and structures the data, preparing it for visualization. The notebook includes steps for data cleaning, calculation of progress rates, and structuring data for PowerBI.
3. **Data Visualization**: PowerBI dashboards display trends, comparisons, and projections in an interactive format, providing stakeholders with actionable insights.

Usage Scenarios
===============

USAID-Tool-1 is suitable for use by:
- **Policy Makers**: To evaluate WASH progress and identify priority areas for intervention.
- **Development Organizations**: To support strategy development, intervention adjustments, and investment planning.
- **Data Analysts**: To explore and analyze data on clean water and sanitation access under various scenarios.

System Requirements
===================

- **Python**: Version 3.7 or higher, with packages listed in `requirements.txt`.
- **Jupyter Notebook**: For running data transformation scripts in an interactive environment.
- **PowerBI**: PowerBI Desktop or a compatible version for data visualization.
