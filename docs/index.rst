WASH Futures Explorer Documentation
===================================

**WASH Futures Explorer** is a tool developed through the USAID Water Security, Sanitation and Hygiene Data & Analytics (WSSH D&A) activity led by Segura and implemented by Akvo. It is designed to help WASH practitioners better understand the potential impacts of accelerating or decelerating investments in WASH services. It allows users to compare different WASH intervention scenarios and assess their impact on various development indicators such as water and sanitation accessibility, health outcomes, prosperity and governance. Built upon data from the International Futures (IF) model from the Pardee Institute at the University of Denver, it combines Python-based data transformations with PowerBI for visualising potential future scenarios.

This documentation will guide you through the various components of WASH Futures Explorer, including data input, transformation processes, and data visualisation and sustainability plan. During the life of WSSH D&A, this will be a living document. Follow the links below to explore each section in detail.
